**Steps to generate API client**

Install the required dependencies
```
# Check Java installation
java -version

# If Java is not installed, install JDK 17 or higher:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y

# Install OpenAPI Generator CLI (7.17.0)
npm install -g @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli@7.17.0

# Ensure that the OpenAPI specification are stored locally
# Example: app/src/main/openApiSpecification/openApiSpecification.json

# Run the command below to generate the client:
./gradlew :app:generateApiClient
# The generated client files are placed inside app/src/main/java/com/nixbug/entebus/data/remote
